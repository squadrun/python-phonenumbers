Please report changes to metadata to the upstream [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/)
project rather than here.

Do not send pull requests with changes in files under any of the following directories:

 - `resources/`
 - `python/phonenumbers/data/`
 - `python/phonenumbers/carrierdata/`
 - `python/phonenumbers/shortdata/`
 - `python/phonenumbers/geodata/`
 - `python/phonenumbers/tzdata/`

All of these directories hold code that is autogenerated from the metadata in the `resources/` directory, which is an
exact copy of the [equivalent directory](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/tree/master/resources) in the
upstream project.
